tech,"Apple makes blogs reveal sources Apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products . The bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in December 2004 following online articles about Apple s Asteroid product . Now Apple has won the right to see e mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit . A lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters . Apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the Asteroid music product and leaking them to the PowerPage , Apple Insider and Think Secret websites . All three are Apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products . Apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value . The lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the Power Page and Apple Insider sites . The separate legal fight with Think Secret has yet to be resolved . In the ruling handed down this week by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg , Apple can now get its hands on e mail records from the bloggers net providers . In making his ruling , Judge Kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest . California has so called shield laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest . The Judge wrote ""... it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of hits on a website about Apple have and will happen . But an interested public is not the same as the public interest Judge Kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists , too . The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is acting as legal counsel for Power Page and Apple Insider , said the ruling had potentially wide implications . Anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl . Mr Opsahl said the EFF was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and US federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent ."
politics,"Talks aim to avert pension strike Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend . Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour s spring conference in Gateshead . They want the government to withdraw regulations due to be introduced in weeks which would raise the pension age for council workers from to . Up to . 4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for March . However , all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election , said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape . In four days , Britain s biggest union Unison will start balloting 800 , 000 local government workers on strikes . Other public sector unions have pledged to follow . It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers . The five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations . This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow , said our correspondent . But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April . Privately ministers believe this will be the less painful option , our correspondent added . The Public and Commercial Services Union PCS will co ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions . PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink . For a government that lectures everyone on choice choice on public service , choice on this and choice on that isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said . If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years that is working until people drop . In the 20th century , it s completely unacceptable Unison s 800 , 000 workers , the Transport and General Workers Union s , 000 and Amicus , 000 are among those being balloted about a March walkout . Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week . It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations ."

tech,"GTA sequel is criminally good The Grand Theft Auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years , but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition . The certificate GTA San Andreas for the PlayStation could have got away with merely revisiting a best selling formula with a more of the same approach . Instead , it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps , carefree , over all the Driv3r and True Crime shaped opposition . Even in the year that will see sequels to Halo and Half Life , it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic . The basic gameplay remains familiar . You control a character , on this occasion a youth named CJ , who sets out on a series of self contained missions within a massive 3D environment . CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push bike to a city bus to a plane . All come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family . To make things worse , he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town , and blackmailed by crooked cops played by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn . The setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional US state of San Andreas , comprising three major cities Los Santos , which is a thinly disguised Los Angeles , San Fierro , aka San Francisco and Las Venturas , a carbon copy of Las Vegas . San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range , cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing . Its ability to capture the ambience of the real world versions of these cities is something to behold , assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since Vice City . The streets , and vast swathes of countryside , are by turns gloriously menacing , grungy and preppy . Flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail , the game s overall look , particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets , is stupendous . The outstanding bread and butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on . Cars handle more convincingly than ever , a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds , and there s more traffic to navigate than before . Park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway , and within seconds there will be a huge pile up . Pedestrians are also out in force , and are a loquacious bunch . CJ can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad . They will pass comments on his appearance and credibility , aspects that the player now has control over . Clothes , tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased , and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool . The character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym . He will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up , but will swell up as a result of over eating . And at last , this is a GTA hero who can swim . At a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young , San Andreas violence , or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence , are sure to inflame the pro censorship brigade . Developers Rockstar have not shied away from brutality , and in some respects ramp it up from past outings . When hijacking a car , for example , CJ will gratuitously shove the driver s head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle . Indeed , the tone is darker than the jokey Vice City . The grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game . This title , incidentally , is set in 1992 , but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists . The wit is still present , just more restrained than in previous outings . A further reason for this is that the incredible range of in vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options , where GTA games trademark humour is anchored . The quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off the chart . The game s rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed . It is a testament to San Andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws , but plus points are so numerous that the niggles don t detract . The on screen map , for instance , is needlessly fiddly , an unwelcome change from past editions . There is also a very jarring slowdown at action packed moments . And the game suffers from the age old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre , setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission . But the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive . You simply will not be bothered by these minor failings . San Andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004 ."

politics,"UK needs tax cuts , Tories insist A major change of direction is needed in Britain if it is to prosper , the shadow chancellor said as the Tory Party spring conference began . Oliver Letwin said the UK could not compete with other countries without the PS4bn tax cuts he was promising . Tory co chairman Liam Fox had opened the forum in Brighton with an attack on Labour s record and party leader Michael Howard is due to speak later . Tony Blair has said Conservative policies would cause economic failure . But Mr Letwin said Britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league . Can this country compete , can this country prosper , unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy he said . If we are going to take on the great challenges , the challenges like those posed by the Chinese and the Indians , we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax he said . The fact is the very carefully costed , fully funded plans we have laid out for saving PS12bn by 2007 2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long term basis Mr Letwin said voting for Labour meant choosing higher taxes , borrowing and waste . Earlier , Dr Fox had said Labour s rule had been characterised by lost trust and failure to deliver He also attacked the government s failure to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS , telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime . A Tory government would sort out the shambles of immigration , put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools , he said . Michael Howard , who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday , will address them in a lunchtime speech . His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party s opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament . The bill was finally passed on Friday evening , after more than hours of debate . Mr Howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill , which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair s promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year ."
tech,"2D Metal Slug offers retro fun Like some drill sergeant from the past , Metal Slug is a wake up call to today s gamers molly coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings . With its hand animated sprites and 2D side scrolling , this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago . But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year . And yes , that includes Halo . Simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2D side scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter . It is also the toughest game you are likely to play , as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on . Players must battle soldiers , snowmen , zombies , giant crabs and aliens , not to mention the huge , screen filling bosses that guard each of the five levels . The shoot anything that moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old school genius . Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers , instead , to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware . Tanks , jets and submarines can be commandeered , as well as cannon toting camels , elephants and ostriches more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq . Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls , and while this is a tough nut to crack , it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go . And at a mere PS20 , Metal Slug is as cheap as sliced , fried spuds , as the man says . Of course , most of you will ignore this , lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters . But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation , Metal Slug is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates eye ."

India s defence budget has also been raised . to 830bn rupees 19bn The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government s Communist allies onside . But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit , which he said would be . of GDP in the year to March 2005 . The country s overall deficit is thought to be more than if the spending of India s states and territories is included . Under the fiscal responsibility law , Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by . percentage points each year , a target he says he has now met for the current year . But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005 target for the deficit will be . Mr Chidambaram said falling short of the new law s requirement . I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act he said . The following year , though , would have to be back on track , he warned . I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means he said . The coming year s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system , although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget . Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament , Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in .

tech,"Games enter the classroom Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom . With violent titles continuing to top the charts , gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn . Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom . Games teach life skills such as decision making , problem solving said Martin Owen , at Futurelab . Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error . Futurelab is a non profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning . Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market . Learning games were somewhat old fashioned and we didn t see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said Dr Carl Gavin , managing director of Lateral Visions . The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element . The result is Racing Academy , a massively multiplayer car racing game , which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well . It is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom . We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game , we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said Mr Owen . Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach . The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs , before and after racing . Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data , work collaboratively and review their own performances . This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved , thinks Mr Owen . The game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive . Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said Ben Williamson , a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools . Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the children s desire to rise to a challenge . Games in the classroom need to support the teacher . It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said . Professor Angela MacFarlane , based at Bristol University , has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms . Use of games in schools has been patchy she found , with Sim City proving the most popular . Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so called edu tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun , she found in her research . It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning . Lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles persuading developers to write for the educational market . This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing . Already there are games on the market , such as Civilisation and Age of Empire , that have educational elements said Mr Owen . Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said . It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though ."
business,"German bidder in talks with LSE Deutsche Boerse bosses have held constructive , professional and friendly talks with the London Stock Exchange LSE its chief has said . Werner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the German group may raise its bid to PS1 . 5bn . 9bn from its initial PS1 . 3bn offer . However , rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle . Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday , the pan European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash . The Paris based exchange , owner of Liffe in London , is reported to be ready to raise PS1 . 4bn to fund a bid . The news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business . However , the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a significantly improved proposal would be in the interests of LSE s shareholders and customers . In the meantime , Euronext , which combines the Paris , Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges , also began talks with the LSE . In a statement on Thursday , Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash , but added that There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange . However , neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE , with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away . Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home . Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London , as well as two members of its executive board . But , Hans Reckers , a board member of Germany s central bank , the Bundesbank , said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt , something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK . It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt . This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants he said . Local government officials in Frankfurt s state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move . It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt s standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe Alois Rhiel , its minister for economic affairs added ."
politics,"EU China arms ban to be lifted The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections , UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said . The year old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China s crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square . Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained . But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma . In December , the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet . The EU s move was welcomed at the time by Beijing , which described the embargo as a product of the Cold War German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted . Britain has been more cautious on the issue , but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end . I have long understood China s argument , that to lump them in with , say , Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don t think it is he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls . He said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July . But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country . If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the EU in wanting the ban lifted . But he said many of Washington s objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries . And intense discussions were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do . Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan . US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses . US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo ."
tech,"Mobiles not media players yet Mobiles are not yet ready to be all singing , all dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players , say two reports . Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles , people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life , said Jupiter . A separate study by Gartner has also said real time TV broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in Europe until 2007 . Technical issues and standards must be resolved first , said the report . Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer , like video playback , video messaging , megapixel cameras and games amongst others . Bringing music download services based on the success of computer based download services will put more demands on battery life . Fifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone , but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets . Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said Thomas Husson , mobile analyst at Jupiter research . Mobile music services should be new and different , and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones , compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music . The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading , after the success of Apple s iTunes , Napster and other net music download services . With phones getting smarter and more powerful , there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move . In the US , services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre recorded TV content onto their phones . But , the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait . Currently , TV like services , where clips are downloaded , are offered by several European operators , like Italy s TIM and . Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though , said the report . Various standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally . In Europe , trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers . A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles hours a day . The service uses 3GP technology , one of the standards for mobile TV . But at the end of 2004 , the European Telecommunications Institute Etsi formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld DVB H as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe . Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real time broadcasts to mobiles , as well as trying to overcome several other barriers . The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed . Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB H standard . TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too , which expects good quality images at low prices , according to analysts . People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens , said Gartner . Digital video recorders , like Europe s Sky box , and video on demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch . As a result , people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control . More powerful smartphones like the XDA II , Nokia 6600 , SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200 , offering web access , text and multimedia messaging , e mail , calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common . A report by analysts InStat MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by over the next five years . It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009 ."

entertainment,"Music man to the Oscars Bill Conti s job of musical director of the Oscars show is not for the faint hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate spinning assignment . This year marks Conti s 17th turn at the helm of the Academy Awards orchestra . The excitement is a live performance as a musician he says . All of your colleagues , everyone in the film industry is in the theatre . All the important people . I guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show . As well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage , it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house . It s a very busy evening , it takes a certain amount of preparation of music , orchestrating , sketching rehearsing , before the show . But you don t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director , it s exciting explains Conti . And much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed . We don t know who the winners will be . So when they say , the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us , they say the name , we play the appropriate one immediately adds Conti . The orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches , despite being told to be brief by the show s producers . The decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via Conti s earpiece . I don t feel good about it at all . It s not my call though he says . When the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall . We don t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off . The person that s been cut off , who s feet from me , is glaring at me like it s death time On occasions , some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak . Julia Roberts , when she came on , she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says . Conti received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff . He also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only . It s a moment in the sun he says . When people get up there , some people , this is hard to believe , people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining , might get a little flustered . But there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met The image of the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories . Behind the scenes , the key players , such as Conti , have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with . There s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls . I can control hearing in my ears , the left ear or the right ear different things at different times . I have to communicate with the director . I have a little microphone that s attached to my headset . To open up that microphone , I have a footswitch he explains . Conti s most nerve wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director , in 1977 , when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke . Conti immediately told the show s director I start cursing and screaming , I tell him we re not going to die for this show you must do something or I m going to climb out of this pit with musicians and we re going to be home in minutes . Oh no Bill don t do anything came the response . Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra , or so of them in the pit and while we re playing , firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands . No one died , it s not a big story , but it was scary at the time laughs Conti . When the ceremony is over , the music director attends the annual Governor s Ball with his family . I have a drink and relive the show he says . I m not for too much carousing . I go home and unwind . It takes me about a day"
tech,"Rings of steel combat net attacks Gambling is hugely popular , especially with tech savvy criminals . Many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid . But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK s biggest net firms to stop these attacks . Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures . Net firms are realising that it s not just about anti virus and firewalls said Paul King , chief security architect at Cisco . There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so called Distributed Denial of Service attacks was with intelligent net based systems . Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres , so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting , said Mr King . This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale . Malcolm Seagrave , security expert at Energis , said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time . Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen , he said . It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said . So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data , said Mr Seagrave . However , he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted . Maria Capella , spokeswoman for net provider Pipex , said that when DDoS attacks were at their height , customers were getting hit every four to five days . The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites . It s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said . We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said Ms Capella . This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries , each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood . Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus . Hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets . Many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail . Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult . Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen . The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail said Ms Capella . We ask , as part of the service we provide , that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up . Energis took a similar approach , said Mr Seagrave . We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said Mr Seagrave . Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from . Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests . He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target . We have people in places where they shouldn t be , monitoring tech sites he said . Sometimes though , he said , spotting the next victim was easy . You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites , trying one after another said Mr Seagrave ."
tech,"Friends fear with lost mobiles People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends . More than of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years . More than half of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book . A fifth rely entirely on mobiles . About of UK adults own at least one mobile , according to official figures . It is estimated that of over 65s own a mobile , according to Intervoice , but the figures are higher for those aged between and . Most to year olds %), and to year olds %), own at least one . Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts information again if the phone was lost , stolen or replaced . The survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book . Many mobile owners do not bother to make back ups of their contact details , and with people changing their phones once a year on average , it becomes a problem . They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart , relying on the mobile phone book instead . We re a nation of lazy so and sos David Noone from Intervoice said . We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can t be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book . The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships ; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart One in three women , the survey said , thought if they lost their phones , it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether . Most said they had no idea what their partner s number was . Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back up services on the network itself , instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves . Generally , information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards , or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software . Sim back up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds . But some operators offer customers free web based back up services too . Orange told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back ups of address books and other data are created online . For non smartphone users , a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone . O2 also offers a free , web based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM . Neither Vodafone or T Mobile currently offer a free network service for back ups , but encourage people to use Sim back up devices . It is thought that about , 000 phones are lost or stolen every month and of total street crime involves a mobile . Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year . Globally , more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004 , more than the previous year , according to analysts . It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005 ."
sport,"Robben and Cole earn Chelsea win Cheslea salvaged a win against a battling Portsmouth side just as it looked like the Premiership leaders would have to settle for a point . Arjen Robben curled in a late deflected left footed shot from the right side of Pompey s box to break the home side s brave resistance . Chelsea had been continually frustrated but Joe Cole added a second with a yard shot in injury time . Nigel Quashie had Pompey s best chance when his effort was tipped over . The Fratton Park crowd were in good voice as usual and , even though Portsmouth more than held their own , Chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances . Striker Didier Drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper Shaka Hislop into a smart save while an unmarked Frank Lampard had a strike blocked by Arjan De Zeeuw . But Pompey chased , harried and unsettled a Chelsea side as the south coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through Quashie . The midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper Petr Cech tipped over at full stretch . Pompey stretched Arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a Chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure . Velimir Zajec s players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but , just as they took a stranglehold of the match , the visitors launched a counter attack . Drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper Hislop back as he blocked before Arjan de Zeeuw cleared the danger . The home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a Glen Johnson header fell to Gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded Pompey goalmouth . The Icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over . But , just like against Arsenal , Portsmouth let in a late goal when Robben s shot took a deflection off Matthew Taylor on its way past a wrong footed Hislop . And Cole put a bit of gloss on a hard fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the Pompey net .

politics,"Women MPs reveal sexist taunts Women MPs endure shocking levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts , a new study shows . Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered melons as women made Commons speeches , researchers from Birkbeck College were told . Labour s Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary . Some MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study Whose Secretary are You , minister The research team , under Professor Joni Lovenduski , had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster . But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber , sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities . Barbara Follet , one of the so called Blair Babes elected in 1997 , told researchers I remember some Conservatives whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts imaginary breasts in their hands and wiggle them and say melons as we spoke Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women s legs or their sexual persuasion . And ex Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women Betty When I said , Look you know my name isn t Betty he said , ah but you re all the same , so I call you all Betty '."" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet Well , you ve only succeeded because you re a woman Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told Oh , you ve had a very fast rise , who have you been sleeping with Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election , and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet , female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world . Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather , the most recent female MP to be elected , told researchers Lots of people say it s like an old boys club . I ve always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school you know a public school full of teenagers Prof Joni Lovenduski , who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists , said she was shocked at the findings . We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent . We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards . This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to put up with the sexist attitudes they came across , Prof Lovenduski said . But she added Some women , including the women who came in 1997 , received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back . What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record ."
politics,"Fox attacks Blair s Tory lies Tony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign , say the Tories . Tory co chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a hard right agenda Dr Fox told BBC Radio If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war , I guess you are going to lie about anything at all He would not discuss reports the party repaid PS500 , 000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat . The prime minister ratcheted up Labour s pre election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference . He insisted he did not know the poll date , but it is widely expected to be May . In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday , Mr Blair said I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of Downing Street He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric , then struggling to live up to the expectations , and reaching the point of raised voices and throwing crockery He warned his supporters against complacency , saying It s a fight for the future of our country , it s a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy , it would result in a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents policies and then attacking the lies . What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear he told BBC News . The Tory co chairman attacked Labour s six new pledges as vacuous and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver . Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid PS500 , 000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election . We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters he said , insisting he enjoyed a warm and constructive relationship to Lord Ashcroft .

In southern and rural seats especially in the South West the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives , who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a touchy feely speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust ."

politics,"Best person for top legal job The best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor , and not necessarily a lawyer or MP , the courts minister has told MPs . Under reforms , the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions . The lord chancellor ... no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor said courts minister Christopher Leslie . The Constitutional Reform Bill was entering its second reading on Monday . Mr Leslie said The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons Under the reforms , the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK s highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers . In December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer . The peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers . The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session , but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed . Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor . He said What matters most is ... whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties . It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an exceptional institution providing a champion of the independence of the judiciary The government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces Mr Grieve said . Convention should be nurtured and celebrated but the government distrusted and disliked it instead . He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords , the government would have great difficulty in getting the Bill through Parliament . Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg , whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor , said the Bill was largely unnecessary , bureaucratic and expensive But the Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham admitted the lord chancellor s role and office cannot be frozen in aspic"
tech,"Windows worm travels with Tetris Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game . The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected . While users play the game , the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks . The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild . The Cellery worm does not spread via e mail like many other viruses . Instead it browses computer networks for PCs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines . When it infects a machine , Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play . As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it . At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines . The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds . Productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing Tetris . PCs running Windows , , ME , NT , 2000 , and XP could be vulnerable to the worm . If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office , your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed rather than something that should cause concern said Graham Cluley , spokesman for anti virus firm Sophos . So far the number of people infected by Cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low . Sophos urged users and companies to update their anti virus software to keep themselves protected ."
entertainment,"Rap feud in Cent s G Unit crew US rap star Cent has said he has thrown protege The Game out of his G Unit gang in a feud that has apparently involved two shootings . In a radio interview on Monday , Cent said the newcomer was disloyal in conflicts with other rappers . A man was shot in the thigh outside New York s Hot studios while Cent was on air . More shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later . Cent appeared on The Game s debut album , which was number one in the US . Cent , whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hip hop s biggest stars , has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including Fat Joe , Nas and Jadakiss . He has claimed credit for the success of The Game , who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene . Both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music . In an interview with Hot on Saturday , The Game described some of Cent s rivals as my friends and said he would not turn on them . Nas is one of my friends , and Jada s really a homie he said . s beef is s beef and I really don t know where all this stems from When Cent appeared on the same station two days later , he said The Game was no longer a member of G Unit . Every record he s selling is based on me being on his record with him he said . When the shooting took place outside the studio , the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel . An unidentified year old Los Angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh . Police say The Game s associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio , where they confronted Cent s entourage . Officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of Cent s management company , Violator . No arrests have been made in relation to either incident . Cent s second album , The Massacre , is released on Thursday , five weeks after The Game s debut , Documentary , went to number one . Elliott Wilson , editor in chief of hip hop magazine XXL , said the feud would boost publicity for Cent s release . It helps him obviously in terms of exposure . You can t ask for better promotion he said . But he added I think he s making more and more enemies . You definitely feel like is he doing too much of a Tupac spiral , like me against the world . You bring more people wanting to see you fail Tupac Shakur was shot dead in 1996 ."
politics,"Turkey deal to help world peace A deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world , Tony Blair has said . The deal , struck at the European Council last week , also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were wrong Mr Blair said . It represented the achievement of an historic British objective he added . Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was anti Islamic Turkey s involvement with the EU would provide an invaluable bridge between Europe and the rest of the world , Mr Howard added . But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey . Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea . He insisted that the Turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records . The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus . It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership . The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member , but Turkey , which occupies northern Cyprus , had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country , calling the issue a red line It could take up to years before Turkey is able to join , and entry cannot be guaranteed . If it joins , Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens . The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005 . However , talks will begin only if the country co operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ."

Investors are betting that the European Central Bank ECB will not do anything to weaken the euro , while the US is thought to favour a declining dollar .

politics,"Police urge pub closure power New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs , bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently , police chiefs have told MPs . Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords . Mr Fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock . He rejected critics calls for the law change to be delayed . Instead , the new Licensing Act could help reduce drunken disorder but only if it was properly planned , he argued . Acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee . After the meeting , Mr Fox said being able to close premises for only hours did not necessarily make an impact . If it s . on a Saturday morning and you close for hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on Sunday anyway . This is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions Under Acpo s proposal , the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority . The new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs but only for hour periods . Mr Fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself . It s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse , and the strategic planning process has been less than useless he said . Mr Fox said the new laws , due to start being phased in next month , could help if food outlets , public transport and public toilets could cope with late night drinkers . Staggering it closing hours will be a solution if the infrastructure is there , if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street he said . We have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event . We have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs . Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing . The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs , councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems . Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes . It was the status quo , not the new laws , which were causing current binge drinking problems , she told BBC Two s Newsnight . Leaked documents have suggested ex Home Secretary David Blunkett branded new opening hours as a leap in the dark But Ms Jowell insisted his concerns had been met . The police s job against alcohol related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time , she added ."

politics,"MPs criticise child access system Divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system , MPs have said . The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access . Courts should be used as a last resort , but where they are , their orders should be enforced more rigorously , MPs said . But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access . Currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount . An arbitrary template imposed on all families , whatever the needs of the child , would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position the MPs said . They said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non resident parent in contested cases . This would reassert the rights of non resident parents to contact with their children , as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents , while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said . Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default they said . Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias , there are considerable grounds for accepting that non resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present . Given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases , we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five month inquiry had been a complex and emotive one . At the moment , far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said . This situation has to change . The court system should only be used as a last resort , where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with . This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country"

It is thought Blackburn want PS6m for the midfielder but chief executive John Williams has confirmed the club are still in dialogue with Rangers . The year old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox . But the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for Ferguson , who moved to Lancashire in 2003 for PS6 . 5m . On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of PS4m . Blackburn have said all along that they want PS6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player swap deal . Williams said We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday , when the winter transfer window shuts . Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking unlikely before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal . We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers he added . The way things are looking , I think it is unlikely we are going to . The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment It is understood that Blackburn accepted a PS5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend . But the player is determined to return to Scotland and rejected a move to Goodison Park .

tech,"How to make a gigapixel picture The largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands . The finished image is . billion pixels in size making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras . The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot . If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution , the picture would be . 5m high and 6m long . The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures . Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail . The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200 , 000 visitors every day . The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the . gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge . The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images . The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003 . That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park , in Utah , and was made up of 196 separate photographs . The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons image . He did it all by hand , which was an enormous effort , and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques , it would be feasible to build a larger image said Jurgen den Hartog , one of the TNO researchers behind the project . We were not competing with Mr Lyons , but it started as a lunchtime bet The Dutch team used already available technologies , although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high resolution image . We had to rewrite almost all the tools Me den Hartog told the BBC News website . All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image , so we had to develop one ourselves The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computer controlled camera with a 400 mm lens . Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite . The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days . Following the success of this project , and with promises of help from others , the TNO team is considering creating a full 360 degree panoramic view of another Dutch city , with even higher resolution ."
business,"Japanese mogul arrested for fraud One of Japan s best known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data . Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world s richest man and ran a business spanning hotels , railways , construction and a baseball team . His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals . He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo . There was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable . Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s , he became one of Japan s most powerful industrialists , with close connections to many of the country s leading politicians . He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998 . But last year , he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire , after being accused of falsifying the share ownership structure of Seibu Railways , one of his companies . Under Japanese stock market rules , no listed company can be more than owned by its largest shareholders . Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the biggest shareholders owned less than this amount . Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange , its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid . Mr Tsutsumi s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies . His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood . The illegitimate third son of a rich father , who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II , he has described the demands his father made . I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987 . He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children . He didn t let me use the silk futon , saying it s a luxury There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too . Last year , twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan s troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank s bad loans ."

Four members of the executive board , including the chairman , David Mackay , have resigned after a simmering row . And Calder said This is terrible news for every level of Scottish rugby . David is a successful businessman and I thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level , it was him Mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee , which contains members elected by Scotland s club sides . He has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can t be run by amateurs said Calder . In fact , I don t understand why we are still having this argument years after professionalism arrived . But I don t believe the rest of the SRU will take this lying down . I think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and , ultimately , it is them who pull the strings . So I wouldn t be surprised if they reviewed their position . But , in the wider picture , what message does this send out He thought the work of Scotland s coaches , who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side , would be made much more difficult . Matt Williams and Willie Anderson must be wondering , what have we walked into here ?'"" said Calder . And we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the Six Nations Championship . I am very , very disappointed , more than you can imagine .

politics,"Mandelson warning to BBC The BBC should steer away from demonising ex Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell , Peter Mandelson has said . The European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour dirty tricks campaign . That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson , who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell s campaigning skills . He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before . That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street sexed up Iraq s weapons of mass destruction dossier . The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies , director general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan . Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard s past . Mr Mandelson , a former Labour communications director , told BBC Radio s Today programme I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills . What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda . In my experience of these things , parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy . I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics , the trivialisation of the campaign . I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone , concentrate on the issues as I say , not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell we all know where that led before Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour , which denies engaging in personal campaigning . Conservative co chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbell s return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard recently withdrawn from the party s website were a sign of abusive politics The government , despite the fact that they would say want to go forward , not back , seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly , about the future he said on Sunday . Labour peer Baroness Kennedy , who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement , said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks . This feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might she said ."

It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors . Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man , Jeremy Jaynes , serve nine years in prison and that his sister , Jessica DeGroot , be fined , 500 . They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e mails using fake addresses . They will be formally sentenced next year . A third defendant , Richard Rutkowski , was acquitted . Prosecutors said Jaynes was a snake oil salesman in a new format using the internet to peddle useless wares , news agency Associated Press reported .

Jaynes amassed a fortune of 24m from his sales , prosecutors said . He s been successful ripping people off all these years AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying . Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100 , 000 e mails in days , Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said . Prosecutors had asked for years in jail for Jaynes , and a jail term for his sister .

politics,"Labour s EU propaganda A taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security , say the Tories . Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution . His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw , who accused the Tories of running scared of debate . EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls , he argued . Mr Straw used Thursday s Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005 . Security , stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July , said Mr Straw . Africa and climate change would also feature highly . He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to of Europe s economic output and were spent where it adds most value Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK s budget rebate , secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher , was fully justified We , like all other countries , have a veto on any changes proposed in this area he said . Mr Ancram condemned the document , which the Foreign Office says has cost about PS2 , 500 to design , print and deliver . Isn t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election ?,"" he asked . The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand . The government , last week , had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this easy and simple constitution to the British people he said . Who are they trying to kid The proposed question for the constitution referendum is Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand . The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006 , with the Tories set to campaign for a no vote . Mr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible . The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade . Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a level playing field on immigration and asylum controls . You are setting your face against all of these things he added . For the Liberal Democrats , Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy . Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets , he argued . Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans , backed by the UK , to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre . Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough ."
politics,"Tories attack EU asylum moves David Blunkett has been accused of using the politics of confusion to disguise new EU immigration measures . Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain . The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states . Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with . He argued closer co operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK . If we don t like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt in or out to suit the British people he said . The home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his Tory opposite number Mr Davis . The government is employing the politics of confusion I think , deliberately argued Mr Davis . By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co operation did not mean losing control of British borders . He said an enlarged member EU needs a streamlined decision making process . Mr Davis said once Britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant . He accused the government of being pathetic when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of surrendering on the issue . And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution , which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over . Mr Blair told his monthly news conference Britain had the best of both worlds and would keep the veto . There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls he said . With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue . The member states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy , in favour of the qualified majority voting QMV system . Under this scheme larger states such as Britain are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states . Britain is expected to retain an opt in right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with . Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a European asylum solution . If we don t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours said Mr Oaten . The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it s right that we don t do this in isolation"
politics,"Defiant hunts put ban to the test Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force . The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal , but vowed to stay within the law . Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence , exercising hounds , chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal . One anti hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent . The man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt , near Ashford . In Wiltshire , police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs . The group , from South Wales and Ireland , have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws . It is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday , just one day after the ban came in . They were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country , with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters . Anti hunt groups such as the League Against Cruel Sports deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity . Mike Hobday , from the league , said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police . Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law , many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting . However , we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said , 000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt . And the BBC s Sarah Mukherjee , with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton , Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt , with 150 on horseback . Tom Heap , BBC rural affairs correspondent , said it appeared that hunstman had , for now , been sticking to the new rules . And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday , he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained . Before riding out with the hunt , former minister Kate Hoey told crowds We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned Judith Moritz , in Melton Mowbray , said anti hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire , but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers . The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations . Chief executive Simon Hart said There has been hunting in England for 700 years . This ban may take two or three years , perhaps two or three months , to unpick . It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service , as broadcasters say Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed . Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter , the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on rural policing , told the BBC the law would be enforced , although the police would not break up hunts . The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law . He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police in the near future to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions ."

business,"Boeing unveils new 777 aircraft US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long distance 777 plane , as it tries to regain its position as the industry s leading manufacturer . The 777 200LR will be capable of flying almost , 000 miles non stop , linking cities such as London and Sydney . Boeing , in contrast to European rival Airbus , hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances . Airbus , which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003 , is focusing on so called super jumbos . Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry . Boeing plans to offer twin engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world s airports , getting rid of the need for connecting flights . It is banking on smaller , slimmer planes such as the 777 200LR and its much anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane , which is set to take to the skies in 2008 . The 777 200LR , which had its launch delayed by the September attacks in the US , is the fifth variation of Boeing s twin aisle 777 plane . The company offically rolled out the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT . Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide . Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful said David Learmount , operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International . But the 777 200LR is a niche player Mr Learmount continued , adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft . Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777 200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders . He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit , prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey . For Airbus , the future is big it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports . From there , passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes . Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft . It has been producing a rival to Boeing s 777 line for more than a year . Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago with its product range , said Flight International s Mr Learmount . Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes . Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777 200LR planes over the next years . It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan . These orders should help underpin the company s profits . Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner , the 717 , and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract . Net profit was 186m PS98m ; 143m euros in the quarter , compared with . 13bn in the same period in 2003 ."

politics,"Choose hope over fear Kennedy Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election , said Charles Kennedy . In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and populist scares He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll . On the Asian tsunami he said it had been very heartening to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons . Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster , which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period . At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties . The general election would be a three party struggle , as the Conservative party fades away as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands , he said . A clear division is emerging in British politics the politics of fear versus the politics of hope . Labour is counting on the politics of fear , ratcheting up talk of threats , crime and insecurity . While the Conservatives are re working their populist scares about asylum and the European menace ',"" he said . He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties . It was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison , ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights , he said . He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury , plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials , curbing of rights to protest , increased stop and search powers and ID card plans . He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination . But at the same time , an overmighty state is a dangerous one he said . His party instinctively understood the new liberal Britain which is no longer a nation with one family structure , and one colour , he said . We are less deferential ; more inclined to think for ourselves ; more open about sexuality and equality . Our national institutions are changing too . We are no longer a nation of one church ; we are a nation of many faiths . In our attitudes and the way we live our lives , this is in many ways a liberal Britain"
tech,"Microsoft plans safer ID system Microsoft is planning to make Windows and Internet Explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information . Info cards will help people manage personal details on their PCs to make online services safer , said Microsoft . Microsoft s two previous programs , Passport and Hailstorm , aimed to protect users but were criticised . ID fraud is one of the UK s fastest growing crimes , with criminals netting an estimated PS1 . 3bn last year . A quarter of UK adults has either had their ID stolen , via hi tech or other means , or knows someone who has , a recent report by Which magazine found . Microsoft is developing a new version of Internet Explorer browser and its operating system , Windows , which has been code named Longhorn . Michael Stephenson , director in Microsoft s Windows Server division , would not confirm however whether the new info cards ID system will be built into the current Windows XP version or Longhorn . We re trying to make the end user experience as simple as possible Mr Stephenson said . The system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure , said Microsoft . While Passport and Hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net , the latest system will store data on a user s PC . It s going to put control of digital IDs into the hands of an end user , the end user will be in full control said Mr Stephenson . Hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company . Passport provides a single log in for more than one website and stores basic personal information . But its popularity suffered after security scares . Up to 200 million Passport accounts were left vulnerable to online theft and malicious hackers after a flaw in the system was exploited in 2003 . Online auction site , eBay , stopped supporting it in January 2005 . Although the flaw was fixed , Microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in Internet Explorer . Last year , it released a major security update for Windows , Service Pack , to combat some of the security concerns . Longhorn is due to be released commercially in late 2006 , but an updated version of Internet Explorer is due for release later this year ."
business,"Bush to outline toughest budget President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress , seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit . About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a . trillion PS1 . trillion package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit . Defence spending will rise , however , while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq . Vice President Dick Cheney said the budget was the tightest so far . At the heart of the administration s fifth budget , presented to Congress on Monday , is an austere package of domestic measures . These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation . Such belt tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush s first term . Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was fair and responsible It is not something we have done with a meat axe , nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society he said . The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , increased expenditure on national security after and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit . The shortfall is projected to rise to 427bn in 2005 . Education , environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to 230bn by 2009 . Most controversially , the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget , which provides health care to the nation s poorest , by 45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by 587m . Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase , although not by as much as originally planned . President Bush s proposals would see the Pentagon s budget rise by 19bn to 419 . 3bn while homeland security would get an extra 2bn . The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , for which the administration in expected to seek an extra 80bn from Congress later this year . Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision . Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to . 5bn trillion over a twenty year period . Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress , the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months . John McCain , a Republican Senator , said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit . With the deficits that we are now running , I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget he said . However , Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009 . The cost of everything he President Bush advocates explodes he said ."

business,"Man Utd to open books to Glazer Manchester United s board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books . Earlier this month , Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club . In a statement , the club said it would allow Mr Glazer limited due diligence to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid . But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer s plans , calling his assumptions aggressive and his plan damaging Many of Manchester United s supporters own shares in the club , and the fan based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer . About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago . Rival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday . Manchester United s response comes as little surprise , as the board made clear . Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal the club said in its statement . Should it become a firm offer , it should be at a price that the board is likely to regard as fair and on terms which may be deliverable But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer s proposal . The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer s business plan assumptions are aggressive the statement said , and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms , in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons . At present , Mr Glazer and his family hold a . stake , making them Manchester United s second biggest shareholders . They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida . If the family makes a formal offer , they will need the support of the club s biggest shareholders . Irish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression , and have yet to express a view on the bid approach . A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds . They have signed a House of Commons motion , and Tony Lloyd , the Manchester Central MP , whose constituency includes the club s Old Trafford ground , has pledged to take the matter to Tony Blair if necessary The Commons motion says any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football However , the DTI has dismissed the proposal . A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non competition grounds . Mr Glazer s offer values the club at PS800m . 5bn Pitched at 300p per share , it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon , which was rejected out of hand . Manchester United shares closed at 270 . 25p on Friday , down . 75p on the day ."
politics,"Police probe BNP mosque leaflet Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque . Anti racism campaigners in Swansea have handed copies to South Wales Police . Swansea s Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church . The building on George Street has been derelict since the 1980s . Taha Idris , director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council , said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public . I m quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the BNP in Swansea he said . The BNP has tried in the past to get into Swansea and this is another example of them trying again . I am in no doubt that the BNP are not needed and not wanted here A South Wales Police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet . According to the BNP s website , they have been posted to homes in the Castle ward . The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin who lives near Welshpool , mid Wales delivering the leaflet . The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion , but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest . Swansea Unite Against Fascism UAF is meeting this week to plan a campaign . Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim , an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea , it organised an anti racism march in the city that was supported by more than , 000 people .

The people of Swansea will not put up with this Swansea s Muslim community bought the former church , just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helen s Road , in the late 1990s . Mr Idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building . It is a landmark building in Swansea and would otherwise just crumble he said . It is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner . It will be a Muslim community centre . It s a holistic place used for education , weddings , deaths and births He said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions Muslims had to travel to Llanelli for cultural events ."

sport,"Italy Ireland Two moments of magic from Brian O Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy . A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer . Italy led early in the second half but Stringer s try gave Ireland a lead they never lost . The hosts cut the gap to with minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia , but Denis Hickie s try ensured an Irish victory . Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes . It could have been better for the hosts but the fly half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O Gara penalty midway through the first half . The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and , for the first quarter , the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs . When they finally did , just before the half hour mark , O Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy . The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner . O Gara missed the twice taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again . Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera , and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a lead . The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O Driscoll , and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors . Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over , with O Gara landing the tricky conversion . A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading as the game entered the final quarter , but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks . Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul . An O Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try . O Driscoll limped off late on , joining centre partner Gordon D Arcy on the sidelines , and the final word went to Italy . Prop Martin Castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an Italian pack which had kept the Irish under pressure throughout .

The firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros 19bn ; PS10bn and new boss Enrico Bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders . He claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions . Parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time . Under Italian law , administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency , if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble . The firm also said it is preparing further law suits . According to the Reuters news agency , of the companies sued on Thursday are Italian while the remaining are international . The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of financial institutions . Among those already targeted are Bank of America , UBS , Credit Suisse First Boston , Deutsche Bank and Citigroup . It has also gone after auditors Grant Thornton . They have all denied any wrongdoing . Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist . In the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company , among other things , had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet .

The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up . at , 740 . points , with the yen strengthening . against the dollar to 104 . yen . Weaker exports , normally the engine for Japan s economy in the face of weak domestic demand , had helped trigger a . contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP .

The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials . Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui , despite warning that other indicators such as the growth numbers had been worrying . Within the overall industrial output figure , there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown . Among the best performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars , chemicals and electronic goods .

Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries Although there are differences between different European nations , the gap between them is closing , the report concluded . The trend for gadgets and technologies , such as digital video recorders DVR broadband , and video on demand will continue across Europe , he added . More than six million UK households now have broadband net . By the middle of 2005 , it is estimated that of all UK net users will be on broadband . Cable company NTL is trialling faster ADSL Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line broadband technology using ADSL2 which can give speeds of 18Mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1Mbps or 2Mbps .

In a speech , he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates . Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations . The PS1bn commitment is part of a five point plan on debt relief , trade , aid , education and health . The chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK s Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday .

That could see donors making long term , legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets . As well as pledging PS960m over years to the immunisation IFF , Britain urged other donors to contribute . If Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra PS4bn . 4bn over years , then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter , Mr Brown argued .

She was born Lilian Alicia Marks in London in 1910 . Her parents were comfortably off her father , a mining engineer , drove a Rolls Royce . When she was eight , her mother took a decision which changed her life . Fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs , she arranged for her to have ballet lessons . Very quickly it became apparent that she was something special . She was spotted by the Russian artistic impresario , Sergei Diaghilev , who wanted her to dance for his company , Ballets Russes . She became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch , and , eventually , with a governess in tow , joined Diaghilev in Monte Carlo when she was .

politics,"Blair defends terror law changes The prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial , saying several hundred people in the UK are plotting terror attacks . The government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes . But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the basic principle Mr Blair told the BBC the control orders would only be used in the most limited circumstances . Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders . But the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders , instead saying judges will be able to quash them . An explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons . On Sunday , Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders . And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last minute negotiations . Some Labour MPs voted against the legislation last week . Barbara Follett , whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era , confirmed she would vote against the government . But the government is continuing to insist that control orders must be issued by the home secretary . Mr Blair told BBC Radio s Woman s Hour We are being advised by the police and the security services ... What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able , being sure enough of the proof , to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt . And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances A YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack . But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in rushing anti terrorism legislation . I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that he really wasn t interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward Mr Clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights . BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords , where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties . Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty , said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue . She said the legislation was a travesty and a perversion of justice and would remain unpalatable even if a judge was involved early in the process ."
entertainment,"UK TV channel rapped for CSI ad TV channel Five has been criticised for sending offensive and threatening advertising material to viewers for a new show about murder scene scientists . Five mailed thousands of fake dossiers including photos of murder victims and an e mail suggesting the recipient was being stalked by a serial killer . Following complaints , the Advertising Standards Authority contacted Five to cease promotion of crime show CSI NY . Five admitted it had sent out , 000 promotion packs but had now stopped . The promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series , a spin off from the highly successful CSI Crime Scene Investigation series , which also runs on Five . The pack also features pictures of forensic evidence from a crime scene and a wanted poster , which did have a CSI NY logo printed in large at the bottom . Five said it had received 100 complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was obvious this material is promoting a drama A Five spokesman said In light of the efforts we have made to make the nature of the contents so transparent we are surprised a very small minority of recipients have mistaken it as anything else . Everyone who was sent this promotion has expressed an interest in receiving details about this particular genre of programming on various websites . We have also received emails and calls from recipients praising the originality and imagination of the campaign"
politics,"Borders rail link campaign rally Campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a Borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened . They will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure , which ran from Edinburgh through the Borders and on to Carlisle , with a walk at Tweedbank . Anne Borthwick , of Campaign for Borders Rail , said reopening the Waverley Line would restore the area s prosperity . MSPs are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through Midlothian to the Borders . Campaigners have said that reopening the Waverley Line , which could cost up to PS100m , would be a huge economic boost for the Borders . In 2000 , Borders Council said the area s economy had suffered since the closure . Ms Borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the Scottish Executive . We are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the Waverley Line she said . Campaign for Borders Rail is the biggest independent lobby group in Scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the Borders and eventually to Carlisle . We believe that it is time for the Scottish Executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future Ms Borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the Scottish Borders . A study in 2000 , which was commissioned by the executive , Scottish Borders Council , Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise , found that a half hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its operating costs . It also found that a half hourly service from Gorebridge to Edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the West Coast Main Line at Longtown could also be reinstated ."

New loans in December rose to , 000 , slightly higher than November s nine year low of , 000 . Mortgage lending rose by PS7 . 1bn in December , up from a PS6 . 4bn rise in November . The figures contradict a survey from the British Bankers Association , which said approvals were at a five year low . Analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness . The modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in December reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply said Global Insight analyst Howard Archer , commenting on the BoE s figures . The BBA believes that the property market is continuing to cool down . Changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in November , thus flattering the December figures , analysts said . In October last year , new rules came into force , which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in November and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly . Separately , the Bank of England said that consumer credit rose by PS1 . 5bn in December , more than the PS1 . 4bn expected and above the PS1 . 4bn reported in the previous month ."

sport,"Federer joins all time greats The last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis , and one country dominate the women s game . Roger Federer became the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in one season . And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open , two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open . Meanwhile , Briton Tim Henman enjoyed his best year , while Greg Rusedski fought back superbly from adversity . Federer began the year as world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles , and set about conquering new ground . The Swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the Australian Open . He ripped through the draw before beating Marat Safin in the final . Andy Roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon , and Federer s performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final was breathtaking . Federer again got the better of Hewitt in the season ending Masters Cup . His victory in Houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final , an Open era record . The only major let down was a third round loss to Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open , and Roland Garros will be his main target in 2005 . There was also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games , which saw Chile dominate as Nicoals Massu took the singles and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win doubles gold . Another major trophy that looks beyond Federer is the Davis Cup , which was won by Spain in a home success over the USA in Seville . Roddick struggled on the clay , losing to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before going down to Carlos Moya in the all important fourth rubber . Henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the French Open a stunning effort and also at the US Open . A quarter final defeat to Mario Ancic at Wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the Briton s defeat , but he remains optimistic of going further next year . British number two Rusedski endured a rollercoaster year , returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in March . With his ranking down at 168 , many feared the year old s career was over , but he battled back in the second half of the season to re enter the top . The Russian women finally delivered on their long recognised promise in 2004 , with Myskina , Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning Grand Slams , before taking the season ending Fed Cup . But while the young Russians were on the way up , it was a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters . Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay , a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo , whose Grand Slam drought goes on . The year started in regulation fashion as Justine Henin Hardenne beat compatriot Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open . A virus ruined the rest of Henin Hardenne s year , although she was fit enough to win Olympic gold , but Clijsters had an even more miserable 2004 . She suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with Lleyton Hewitt , and will be happy to see the year end . In their absence , Myskina thrashed Elena Dementieva in a historic , but woeful , all Russian final at the French Open . Wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as Sharapova captivated SW19 , showing nerves of steel as she battled past Davenport and Serena Williams to take the title . Davenport was a strong favourite for the US Open but , hampered by injury , lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis . Kuznetsova went on to give Dementieva another Grand Slam final thrashing , with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year . With the Russians still improving , the likes of Henin Hardenne , Clijsters , Davenport , Mauresmo , Venus and Serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005 . And it may take their compatriot Safin to challenge Federer on the men s side ."
tech,"Progress on new internet domains By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names . The . post and . travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net s administrative body . The names are just two of a total of proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , Icann . The other proposed names include a domain for pornography , Asia , mobile phones , an anti spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture . The . post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co ordinate the e commerce efforts of national post offices . The . travel domain would be used by hotels , travel firms , airlines , tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online . It is backed by a New York based trade group called The Travel Partnership . Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted . Despite this initial approval , Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service . At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains . One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a . xxx domain for pornographic websites . A similar proposal has been made many times in the past . But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it . In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success . Three of the new so called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as . museum and . aero . Others such as . info and . biz were intended to be more generic . In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations . But domains that end in the . com suffix are by far the most numerous ."

business,"Business fears over sluggish EU economy As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution , many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home namely how to stay in business . Lille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend . But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce , which stands beside the Opera House , and consider that it was built like the town halls in many northern English towns on the wealth created by coal , steel and textiles Like northern England and industrial Scotland , those industries have been in long term decline the last coal pit closed in 1990 . Beck Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres , about miles from Lille . The company has not laid off a worker since 1945 . It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry , but not many of those are being built in Europe these days . Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply , while his key markets are now in China and India . In our business the market is absolutely global , you can not imagine living with our size of business even within an enlarged European Union , if we did that we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200 he says . It isn t just globalisation that is hurting ; the law in France means workers are paid for a hour week even though they work just hours . But at least there is still a steel industry . Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling . New business has been attracted , but not enough to make up the difference . That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU , says Frederic Sawicki , a politics lecturer at the University of Lille . In the region today the unemployment rate is in some areas it is They don t see what Europe is doing for them , so there is a kind of euro scepticism , especially in the working classes he says . Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here . The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone , but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world . Much of that trade passes through the world s largest port , Rotterdam , in Holland , home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec . Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed , but Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China , where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer . Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home . In the US growth is something like in China they are estimating and in the EU it is more or less %,"" he says . Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand . He much preferred the old currencies of Europe , which moved in relation to each country s economic performance . In Germany , industry is exporting more these days , but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment . Growth is likely to peak this year at just under In Britain that would be a bad year ; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years . With Germany making up a third of the eurozone s economy , this is a major problem . If Germany doesn t once again become the powerhouse of Europe , growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be . However , at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing . The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs , 000 staff . Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay , after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary . Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly %"". But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China . The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system , but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers , says Helmut Schneider , director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University . Labour is too costly in Germany , especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem . If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half he says . The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010 . Four years into that process , and the target seems further away than ever ."
tech,"Anti spam screensaver scrapped A contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped . Lycos Europe s Make Love , Not Spam campaign began in late November but its tactics proved controversial . Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti spam measures and had now achieved this aim . The anti spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law . Through the Make Love , Not Spam website , users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages . More than 100 , 000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered . The company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites . But the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming type tactics against the senders of junk mail . Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action . Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti spam campaign was proving a little too successful . According to response time figures gathered by Netcraft , some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests . In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme , the company denied that this was its fault . There is nothing to suggest that Make Love , Not Spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted it said . At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down , they were not in fact part of the Make Love , Not Spam attack cycle it added . The statement issued by Lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with spare capacity . The idea was simply to slow spammers sites and this was achieved by the campaign the company said . Many security organisations said users should not participate in the Lycos Europe campaign . The closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism ."

I definitely want to stay at City because I have really improved as a player here Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is said to have been impressed enough by Dunne s turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the January transfer window .

business,"Troubled Marsh under SEC scrutiny The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh McLennan s shareholder transactions , the firm has said . The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firm s shares . Marsh has said it is co operating fully with the SEC investigation . Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney general into whether insurers rigged the market . Since that inquiry was launched in October , Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board . Prosecutors allege that Marsh the world s biggest insurance broker and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover . This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York s top law officer , Eliot Spitzer , and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California . The SEC s investigation into so called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds , managed by MMC Capital , the company s private equity firm . Marsh s new chief executive , Michael Cherkasky , is trying to negotiate a settlement with Mr Spitzer . Mr Spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America s misdeeds . The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies Standard Poor s , Moody s and Fitch to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks . According to the Financial Times , insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year . Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind ."

tech,"Video phone help for deaf people Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language BSL could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter . The Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People RNID but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people s pockets . The RNID is urging telecoms regulator , Ofcom , to reduce the cost of the service from the current PS7 . per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls . The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone , and the interpreter then relays the deaf person s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person s response into sign language . For many deaf people , especially those born deaf , BSL is a first and preferred means of communication . Until now , the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator . In the past , I ve used textphones but they have problems said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot . I communicate in BSL ; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call . There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people said RNID technology director , Guido Gybels . In the US and Australia , sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call . By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users , the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group Ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year . And new technology , including the Video Relay Service , will be discussed with interested parties in the near future . But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation . Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider he said . Mr Currington , like many of the UK s , 000 BSL users , will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost effective service available . The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure he said . I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls"
business,"Fiat mulls Ferrari market listing Ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat s carmaking operations , the Financial Times has reported . It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a 2bn . 53bn euros ; PS1 . 05bn settlement with GM about Fiat s ownership . Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together , it said . Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo , Fiat s car business is making a loss . Under the proposals which the paper said could be announced within days the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market . Fiat owns a stake in Ferrari best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team having first bought into the business in 1969 . It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros 1bn That sale valued Ferrari which owns the Maserati brand at . 3bn euros . The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out . The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies . Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing , distribution and research development costs . Maserati and Ferrari sell about , 000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003 . Fiat , Italy s largest private sector employer , did not comment on the reported changes . Fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with General Motors . The US firm agreed to pay 2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright . Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business ."
sport,"Hewitt survives Nalbandian epic Home favourite Lleyton Hewitt came through a dramatic five set battle with Argentine David Nalbandian to reach the Australian Open semi finals . Hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two set lead . But Nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider . Hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win and set up a meeting with Andy Roddick . The winner of that match will face either Roger Federer or Marat Safin in the final . Ninth seed Nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match , and there was no indication he would do so as Hewitt dominated the first two sets . The Argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying Hewitt s exuberant on court celebrations were not very good for the sport And he had words with Hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the Australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs . The balance of power changed completely in the third set as Hewitt allowed his level to dip , and he double faulted twice as Nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set . But the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat . He then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes . I just kept hanging in there . It was always tough serving second in the fifth set said Hewitt , who had never reached the last four at his home Grand Slam . I told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again . It s a long way from holding that trophy up there but I m hanging in there . Only four guys left that can win and we re the top four in the world . It s set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals"

business,"Jobs growth still slow in the US The US created fewer jobs than expected in January , but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years . According to Labor Department figures , US firms added only 146 , 000 jobs in January . The gain in non farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190 , 000 new jobs . Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to . its lowest level since September 2001 . The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate albeit by a very fine margin a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office . He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November s Presidential election the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover . As a result , job creation became a key issue in last year s election . However , when adding December and January s figures , the administration s first term jobs record ended in positive territory . The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004 , from 157 , 000 to 133 , 000 . Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions . It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace said Rick Egelton , deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group . We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth said Ken Mayland , president of ClearView Economics . That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers"

politics,"Petrol duties frozen , Brown says Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre budget speech to the Commons on Thursday . Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments . But this financial year , because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen . During 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution . He said It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services . But this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market I propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties The RAC welcomed the news , calling it an early Christmas present for motorists . But the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol . Environmental group Transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists . We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman . In 2000 the People s Fuel Lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow moving convoys after Mr Brown threatened to raise fuel taxes . The chancellor did not raise duty that year , but despite threats of more protests in 2003 , he added . 28p per litre ."

sport,"Castaignede fires Laporte warning Former France fly half Thomas Castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach Bernard Laporte following their defeat by Wales . France suffered a shock loss against the Welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win . Castaignede told BBC Sport The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand , a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England . But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November , France were deemed by many to be the world s leading side . But they were then trounced by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener . It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against England at Twickenham . lt ; Castaignede said You can t say any of those results have eased the pressure on Laporte . Had England s kickers not been so bad , the position in the Six Nations would be very different now Laporte has been criticised for France s negative tactics in their wins over Scotland and England . But his side played a more free flowing style against Wales , making a mockery of the opposition s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval . All the chat in France has been about how France will play against Ireland said Castaignede ahead of the March tie . Everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against Wales . But everyone also wants a win Castaignede , a veteran of international caps , admitted the French would go in as underdogs against Ireland . Going to Ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now , it s harder than ever said Castaignede . They re very experienced and don t often lose at home . They ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break Despite praising the Irish he claimed the Welsh had the upper hand in the Six Nations run in . Ireland have such a good pack but Wales are something else on the break he added . At the weekend they were simply awesome . As a Frenchman it was disappointing to see , but you had to admire it . Their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship The year old also tipped Yann Delaigue to start ahead of Frederic Michalak at number after an impressive display in Paris last weekend . Delaigue played really well and admittedly Michalak played well too said Castaignede . I m just glad I m not the one who has to make the decision"

Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down . on Tuesday , after Monday s gain on hopes of a payoff . The US firm is thought to be offering about 2bn PS1 . 06bn to extricate itself from the arrangement . It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat s decision to sell off Fiat s finance arm and halve GM s stake via a capital raising effort . The 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat . The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright . But Gianni Agnelli , the godfather of the group , wanted to keep control , and preferred GM s offer to buy a stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future , known as a put option Since then , however , Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses , while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GM s stake in half to For its part , GM s European units Opel and Saab have both had trouble , with Opel management threatening to cut , 000 jobs .

It is the highest ever daily total recorded by the Mobile Data Association MDA It represents an increase of on last year s figures . Wishing a Happy New Year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year s largest party . While texting has not quite overtaken the old fashioned phone call , it is heading that way , said Mike Short , chairman of the MDA . In the case of a New Years Eve party , texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background he said . There were also lots of messages sent internationally , where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible , he said . The British love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn , according to MDA . The MDA predicts that 2005 could see more than 30bn text messages sent in the UK . We thought texting might slow down as MMS took off but we have seen no sign of that said Mr Short . More and more firms are seeing the value in mobile marketing . Restaurants are using text messages to tell customers about special offers and promotions . Anyone in need of a bit of January cheer now the party season is over , can use a service set up by Jongleurs comedy club , which will text them a joke a day .

He was , had been suffering from cancer for many months , and died at his London home . That failed stalking horse leadership challenge made it easier for Michael Heseltine to mount his own bid . That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into Downing Street , after the second ballot .

Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer was born on October , 1920 . Educated at Eton , and at New College , Oxford , he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy . He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 by votes . Labour regained the seat two years later , and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re enter Parliament .

tech,"Screensaver tackles spam websites Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail . Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out . The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool , spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data . We ve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said Malte Pollmann , spokesman for Lycos Europe . In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said , but now we are going to go one step further We ve found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver , Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity . Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with . He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web . Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said , about one MP3 file But , he said , if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day . Lycos did not want to use e mail to fight back , said Mr Pollmann . That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said . The sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer . Typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day . The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop . To limit the chance of mistakes being made , Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods . As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs , the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive , said Mr Pollmann . Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests . Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver . While working , the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data . The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden . Despite the soft launch , Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than , 000 times in the last four days . There s a huge user demand to not only filter spam day by day but to do something more he said Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive"
tech,"Ink helps drive democracy in Asia The Kyrgyz Republic , a small , mountainous state of the former Soviet republic , is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting . This new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population . In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as an island of democracy the Kyrgyz President , Askar Akaev , pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections . The US government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision . The Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid 1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003 , reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with deputies . The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the German Embassy , the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes . The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated . The ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb . It dries and is not visible under normal light . However , the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light . At the entrance to each polling station , one election official will scan voter s fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter , and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot . If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station . Likewise , any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot . These elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the Autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former Soviet Republics , notably Ukraine and Georgia . The use of ink has been controversial especially among groups perceived to be pro government . Widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society . The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink . The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance . Local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful , radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems . Others , such as the aggressively middle of the road , Coalition of Non governmental Organizations , have lauded the move as an important step forward . This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world , in countries as varied as Serbia , South Africa , Indonesia and Turkey . The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink but as the elections in Afghanistan showed , improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems . The use of invisible ink is not without its own problems . In most elections , numerous rumors have spread about it . In Serbia , for example , both Christian and Islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion . Other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink various soft drinks , solvents and cleaning products are put forward . However , in reality , the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off . The ink stays on the finger for at least hours and for up to a week . The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills . The passage of the inking law is , nevertheless , a clear step forward towards free and fair elections The country s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for February .

business,"Giving financial gifts to children Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas , but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future Gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact . It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs , for example . The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age , through its new Child Trust Fund . The first vouchers , worth PS250 or PS500 for low income families , will be distributed from January . All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible . Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005 . Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to PS1 , 200 a year , which will grow free of income and capital gains tax . As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas , relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account , and use this as a feeder fund . There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest . Some of the best instant access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society , paying . for a minimum balance of PS1 and the Alliance Leicester FirstSaver which pays . also starting at PS1 . Interest earned by children is subject to income tax . However , children , like adults , have a personal income tax allowance PS4 , 745 for the current tax year If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives but not parents any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance . As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance , then no tax will be payable . When the account is opened a form R85 available from the bank or building society , should be completed . This confirms that the account holder is a non taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax . The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child . Only PS100 of interest per parent can be tax free . Where interest exceeds this level , the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent . This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances . Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child , consideration should be given to opening separate accounts one for parents gifts and one for gifts from other relatives . Therefore , it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free , with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual PS1 , 200 limit being directed to a deposit account . Another favourite solution is Premium Bonds . With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account , they make great presents . The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase . Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian . The minimum for each purchase is PS100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of PS10 . There are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored . Over the longer term , stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment , although in the shorter term they can be volatile . One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term more than ten years which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares . One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust . These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares . These funds may be actively managed , where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential , or passive , where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index , for example , the FTSE 100 . Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market . These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index so are really another form of tracker The difference is that the charges are quite low . The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age , and parents will have no control over how it is spent . For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income ."

The additional bans come into effect from December meaning Camara will also be unavailable for the home game against Livingston while Novo will miss the meetings with Dundee United and Dunfermline . An SFA spokesman said They have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before Friday . But if they do appeal it won t be heard before this weekend because it takes a bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal Meanwhile , Bob Malcolm and Rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to Rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game . Malcolm , a substitute on the day , was taken from the Rangers dug out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made . But the SFA would not detail what , if any , punishment Malcolm would receive . Once Rangers receive our letter we will be in a position to make a comment on the findings added the spokesman ."
